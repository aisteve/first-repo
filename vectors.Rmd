## Vectors Illustration

Create a vector containing the accident status of the passengers
Those that survived represent 1 and those that did not survive represent 0
Assign it to survived object
And display survived values
Create survived2 with random survived status of length 20
Create snames for the passenger of length 20 and their age respectively

```
survived <- rep(c(0, 1), times = 20)
survived
survived2 <- c(0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0)
snames <- c(
